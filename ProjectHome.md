A CUDA port of the Dalal and Triggs pedestrian detector.  On a Core i7 920 (2.66GHz) with an NVidia Geforce GTX 280 graphics card running on Debian Lenny Linux, this code runs up to 76x faster than the CPU-only version.

A version with updated algorithms and documentation is forthcoming.

If you use this code to produce results published in academic venues (conferences, journals, etc.), various papers must be cited.
